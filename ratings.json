Not terrible, but make sure you brush up on general programming first."

There is not too much work for the class, but it's not difficult. Extra problems offered for more practice. Encourages students to go to office hours. Spends ~20 minutes per class covering questions on homework."

Concrete examples in class with live programming. Before delving into actual patterns he does a great review of SOLID. Allows resubmissions on homework. Very strict time limit on exams though. Very helpful !"

Gives out a study sheet and tells you what concepts are important to know so you'll do well as long as you study."
